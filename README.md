# product_scraper.py
To create a program that extracts product information from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a CSV file, Iâ€™ll need to use web scraping techniques. For this, I'll use Python with the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape data, and the csv module to store the data in a CSV file.

# Product Scraper

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/product-scraper.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
